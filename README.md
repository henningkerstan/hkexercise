# The hkexercise Package
A LaTeX package to count exercises and points

**NOTE: This package has been renamed to *exercisepoints*. See https://github.com/henningkerstan/exercisepoints for all upcoming development.**

## Introduction and Usage
This package can be used to facilitate exercise counting and exercise point counting in a LaTeX-document. It counts the number of exercises and it sums all the points of the exercises in a document. 
Especially for exams it is also common to have an overview of all exercises and their maximal points. This is also supported by this package by providing a macro to retrieve the points of each exercise.

### Load the Package
To use this package copy the file ‘hkexercise.sty’ into the same folder as your document (or, if you plan to use it more often, copy it into your local texmf directory) and load it by typing
```
    \usepackage{hkexercise}
```
anywhere in your document’s preamble. There are no options and this package does not require any other packages to be loaded (it loads the ifthen package).

### Typeset a First Exercise
Now you can typeset your first exercise using the following code.
```
\begin{exercise}[Simple Addition] 
    What is 1+1?\points{2.5}
\end{exercise}
```

### Further Information
For further information please read the package documentation in ‘hkexercise.pdf’ (you can either obtain this file from the GitHub releases page or simply compile the file ‘hkexercise.tex’ twice with pdflatex).
